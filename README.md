# Cryptocurrency Exchange App

>This React capstone project is about building a mobile web application to check a list of metrics (numeric values) which I created using React and Redux. I selected an API that provides numeric data about cryptocurrency exchange and then build the webapp around it. 

The app was built using React documentation, React components, React props, React Router, connecting React and Redux, and handling events in a React app. Integration tests were written with a React testing library. The project also used React lifecycle methods, store, actions and reducers.

The styling was done to match the style created by Nelson Sakwa on Behance.
